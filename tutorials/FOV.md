# **🕶️ Changing FOV to 82 in Minecraft**  

The **Field of View (FOV)** in Minecraft controls how much of the world you can see on your screen. A higher FOV gives a wider view, while a lower FOV zooms in. This guide will show you how to set your **FOV to 82** in both **Minecraft: Java Edition** and **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**.
